# Webhook for Dialogflow Agent

This project is used as a webhook in my Dialogflow agents. It is a simple REST API using Express framework.

## Getting Started

It provides fulfillment for following two chatbots

### Movie&Weather chatbot

A simple demo bot that can give information about movies by movie name and give weather information of any city by its name.

### Hindi chatbot

Built to demonstrate how a Hindi chatbot can be created and trained. It can save phone numbers and retrive them when requested by the user. It is integrated with a custom frontend which can be found [here](https://github.com/prandon/chatbot_frontend).
